                                            When it comes to building a home, it’s not just about bricks and mortar — it’s about passion, dreams, hopes, and imagination coming together to shape a family’s future.
                                            Yet, for many, this dream turns into stress when expectations are not met. Scarlet Homes was born out of this very realization.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="sub-heading margin-top-15">
                                            Scarlet Homes came into existence when both founding Directors, <strong>Bharat</strong> and <strong>Pradip</strong>, decided to make customized luxury a reality — not an impossible milestone.
                                            With “Custom Homes for Your Simplicity” as its driving vision, Scarlet entered the market with one mission: to make the process of building a dream home smooth, transparent, and truly rewarding.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="sub-heading margin-top-15">
                                            In the early days, Scarlet faced the same challenges every new builder faces — market competition, trust-building, and refining the perfect inclusion packages. But through persistence, integrity, and innovation,
                                            Scarlet Homes overcame these obstacles. Today, its biggest strength lies in its people — a team that truly listens, adapts, and delivers homes that reflect the owner’s individuality.

With time the business grew to multi-site operation and well known in market both for Bakers Delight group and with Nepalese cohort. Being open, fun filled, and charming person, Bharat had a lot of friends.

                                            During many instances, he came across a lot of people having their dreams ruined due to a developer, not meeting expectations or having to break their banks at end in the name of variations, or having to settle down in simple project homes despite paying a good sum of Money. He always saw an opportunity here to do something about it.

                                           During the pandemic, when market slowed down, and he got some spare time from his business, he started formulating the concept of Scarlet home. But he knew it wasn’t one man army game, so he turned out to Pradip, his old friend, who too was looking forward for similar plans and thus Scarlet came into function.

Many of them were because they never were part of the construction, or design, or it was not met to their expectations.
                                        </p>

                                           He saw an opportunity there to be a builder and ensure clients get what they were looking for. With covid slashing market, Pradip took a step down from Rest Function Center and was working to expand Rest Real Estate into building. That’s when Bharat, his old friend, who too was looking forward for similar plans and thus Scarlet came into function.
